# Unsupervised Machine Learning

This repository contains Python implementations of **unsupervised machine learning algorithms**
as part of my **academic laboratory coursework**.  
All algorithms are implemented using standard machine learning libraries and are organized
experiment-wise as per the university syllabus.

The repository will be continuously updated as new experiments are completed.
